## Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommender System** using machine learning techniques in Google Colab. The system leverages the TMDB movie metadata dataset to provide personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity. The recommender utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie descriptions, genres, and cast details.

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends movies based on similarities in attributes such as genres, cast, and plot summaries.
- **NLP Techniques**: Uses NLTK for text processing, including stemming and removing stopwords.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit to allow users to easily input their preferences and receive recommendations.
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Provides recommendations based on user input in an interactive format.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit
- Google Colab

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning-In-Google-Colab.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit
   ```

3. Open the project in Google Colab for easy execution and interaction.

## Usage
1. **Load the Dataset**: Use the TMDB movie metadata dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) or directly through the provided links in your Google Colab notebook.
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the code blocks to preprocess the data and train the recommendation model.
3. **Get Recommendations**: Use the provided functions to input movie titles and receive personalized movie recommendations.
4. **Interactive Demo**: Run the Streamlit application by executing the appropriate commands in your Google Colab environment.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **TMDB movie metadata dataset**, which includes information such as:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Cast and crew
- Overview
- Release date
- Ratings and more.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## Content Based Recommender System
The recommender system is designed to analyze movie features such as:
- **Genres**: The genre(s) of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy).
- **Cast**: Lead and supporting actors in the movie.
- **Overview**: A brief summary of the movie plot.

The system combines these features to compute the similarity between movies and suggest the most relevant options based on user preferences.
