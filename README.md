## Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommender System** using machine learning techniques in Google Colab. The system leverages the TMDB movie metadata dataset to provide personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity. The recommender utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie descriptions, genres, and cast details.

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends movies based on similarities in attributes such as genres, cast, and plot summaries.
- **NLP Techniques**: Uses NLTK for text processing, including stemming and removing stopwords.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit to allow users to easily input their preferences and receive recommendations.
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Provides recommendations based on user input in an interactive format.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit
- Google Colab
